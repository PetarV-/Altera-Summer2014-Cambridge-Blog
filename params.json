{"name":"Altera-Summer2014-Cambridge","tagline":"","body":"### Week 1\r\nDuring the first week of our internship, we have:\r\n\r\n- Attended Altera's training session in High Wycombe;\r\n- Learnt the basics of Bluespec SystemVerilog and used it to program several example modules;\r\n- Got all of Quartus' tools to work by locating missing libraries, fixing rules for USB device permissions, etc;\r\n- Booted the ARM processor on the SoCKit using an SD card containing Linux;\r\n- Interfaced to the ARM in two ways: initially using Minicom over a USB connection, now also via Ethernet+SSH to ease file transfer.\r\n- Successfully programmed the FPGA using the ARM (on-boot) as well as JTAG.\r\n- Established basic communication ARM -> FPGA, in the following manner:\r\n  * Wrote a simple BSV module implementing an Avalon Slave that takes a number and returns it tripled;\r\n  * Connected the module to an 'HPS' component in Qsys and programmed the full design to the FPGA (using the ARM);\r\n  * Wrote a C program that writes integers to a memory-mapped hps2fpga bridge;\r\n  * Successfully ran the C program on the ARM chip, getting tripled values back from the FPGA.\r\n\r\nFor the following week, we hope to:\r\n\r\n- Achieve communication FPGA -> ARM (hopefully directly accessing SDRAM, maybe peripherals?);\r\n- Obtain a second SoC board.\r\n- Decide on a project.\r\n\r\n---\r\nLawrence and Petar","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

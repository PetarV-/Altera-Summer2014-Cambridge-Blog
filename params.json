{"name":"Altera-Summer2014-Cambridge","tagline":"","body":"### Week 5\r\n\r\nWe're now halfway through our internship - here are some of our impressions from the fifth week.\r\n\r\nLawrence:\r\n- Successfully bridged BERI's debug unit over to the ARM and the Ethernet.\r\n- Built a component that can be driven by the existing JTAG UART driver on BERI to allow serial communication to the ARM; used this to make a console for BERI.\r\n- Merged all of my changes into a colleague's branch, waiting for push.\r\n\r\nPetar:\r\n- Over the weekend I have discovered Xillybus - a custom component that takes care of establishing a communication channel between the ARM and the FPGA, immediately presenting files on the ARM side and FIFOs on the FPGA side for easy usage. This will likely not be very useful because of its restrictive licensing, however I have conducted a few tests with it to see how high a bandwidth it can achieve - the results were in the range of 60-80 MB/s.\r\n- Afterwards I started work on developing my own communication channel - to do this I utilised BRAMs on the FPGA side where data could be written from one side and read from the other. The sides notify each other of their status by using interrupts. \r\n- I have eventually successfully developed and tested a communication channel library in C, with most of its actions done in userspace (only the interrupts are handled in kernel modules). Timing tests (using a NIOS processor on the FPGA side) revealed that the potential bandwidth (with already prepared data prior to sending) is ~10.5 MB/s in either direction.\r\n- This is already likely to be useful, however it is possible to speed things up and/or make them simpler by writing more elaborate kernel modules that would present files that could simply be written into or read from in userspace. I have hence started to get more involved with kernel programming, and will likely use a significant part of next week trying to move as many actions of my library as possible away from userspace.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Week 4\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of the work we undertaken in this busy week.\r\n\r\nLawrence:\r\n- Last week I have synthesised BERI on the SoCKit board. This week, FreeBSD was successfully booted on BERI (after having obtained an appropriate kernel build).\r\n- I successfully connected the debug channels for BERI with the ARM.\r\n- The debug stream is not as efficient as hoped - I started working on improving its performance by modifying the C code controlling it.\r\n\r\nPetar:\r\n- Initially, the goal was to interface to PixelStream -- this was successfully performed and combined with the exercise ported last week, giving us useful output of the Mandelbrot set (with colours) over VGA. Tried a variety of configurations and resolutions - the highest achieved stable resolution is 1024 x 768.\r\n- Afterwards I explored the possibilities of running an X server on the ARM. This might be useful to enable f.ex. the CHERI processor to launch X applications over SSH, exploiting the ARM for graphical processing power. This involved several subproblems:\r\n  * Successfully running an LXDE desktop on the ARM side - for this, an SD card image provided by Rocketboards was used.\r\n  * The image didn't contain sshd, so it was necessary to connect the ARM to the University network to download it. This required assigning the device a MAC address - as a base for that, I used Altera's Chip ID megafunction to extract the chip's unique identifier.\r\n  * Fixing all the required network configuration files to enable the board to access the internet.\r\nUltimately, an X server was successfully hosted on the ARM, and we successfully accessed it from several machines in the Computer Laboratory.\r\n- For next week, the idea is to work on establishing a communication channel between the ARM and a processor on the FPGA -- will use the NIOS initially as it's easier to synthesise than the BERI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Week 3\r\n\r\nLawrence and I have finally obtained additional SoCKits at the end of week 2, so we were finally able to pursue separate ideas. As such, the blog posts will from now on be split between us.\r\n\r\nLawrence:\r\n- Conducted a few tests involving getting a Bluespec component to use the DRAMs on the FPGA.\r\n- Spent most of the week trying to synthesise BlueVecII (a vector coprocessor) onto the FPGA. It initially couldn't fit, so had to be trimmed down; however, in the end the synthesis still failed due to the way it was configured. This idea might be briefly revisited.\r\n- Successfully placed the BERI processor on the FPGA and managed to partially boot FreeBSD on it (waiting on a more suitable build of the kernel for this board).\r\n\r\nPetar:\r\n- Initial goal was to fix the kernel versions problem from last week that prevented us from compiling a correct interrupt-handling kernel module. After lots of reformats, I think we finally have a good custom SD card image, containing a manually-compiled kernel, and a choice of useful tools. A working example of an interrupt processing kernel module has since been built and successfully loaded; our own kernel module built last week currently has some undecipherable errors upon initialisation, we will possibly try to re-write it later.\r\n- Main goal for the week was porting an exercise from the Cambridge ECAD practicals (can be accessed from [this link](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/ECAD+Arch/labs/lab2/lablet2_2_1.html)) to the SoCKit, using the ARM as a substitute for the NIOS and (for now) the on-board LCD instead of the tPad's touchscreen. This involved reading through and understanding Altera's FIFO utilities and libraries for handling the ring processor for the TTCs (both written originally for the NIOS, in C) and rewriting them to be suited for the ARM. In addition I familiarised myself with the API for the LCD. The exercise was successfully ported.\r\n- For next week, the main plan is to interface to PixelStream, a Bluespec component that could be used to communicate to VGA devices.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Week 2\r\nDuring the second week of our internship, we have:\r\n\r\n- Successfully achieved communication FPGA -> ARM, through directly writing to the ARM's SDRAM.\r\n- Extended this to support a logical memory model for the FPGA; more precisely:\r\n  * On the ARM, we implemented memory-mapping page-sized chunks, linked together in a doubly-linked list structure (such that the start of each chunk is filled with information such as size and pointers to the previous and next chunk).\r\n  * From the FPGA side, we have designed a custom component in Bluespec to handle memory address translation. It consists of:\r\n    - An Avalon slave connected to the hps2fpga bridge, receiving the address of the first page in the list from the ARM.\r\n    - Another Avalon slave which can be linked to any component's master, receiving a request to write at a particular logical address (word-indexed from 0); this request is then translated into the actual address(es) on the ARM and sent to\r\n    - An Avalon master connected to the fpga2hps bridge, writing directly into the relevant page(s) in the linked list structure on the ARM's SDRAM.\r\n- This is currently all implemented using polling, we're currently trying to get interrupts to work properly. We wrote a kernel module for the ARM that receives interrupts, and additional C code that processes them (by reading from a \"file\" provided by the module). However we didn't get it to work yet, probably due to different versions of the Linux kernel we have on the board and what was used to compile the module.\r\n- We also obtained additional SoCKit boards, which should help speed up development and give us a wider range of things to look at.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Week 1\r\nDuring the first week of our internship, we have:\r\n\r\n- Attended Altera's training session in High Wycombe;\r\n- Learnt the basics of Bluespec SystemVerilog and used it to program several example modules;\r\n- Got all of Quartus' tools to work by locating missing libraries, fixing rules for USB device permissions, etc;\r\n- Booted the ARM processor on the SoCKit using an SD card containing Linux;\r\n- Interfaced to the ARM in two ways: initially using Minicom over a USB connection, now also via Ethernet+SSH to ease file transfer.\r\n- Successfully programmed the FPGA using the ARM (on-boot) as well as JTAG.\r\n- Established basic communication ARM -> FPGA, in the following manner:\r\n  * Wrote a simple BSV module implementing an Avalon Slave that takes a number and returns it tripled;\r\n  * Connected the module to an 'HPS' component in Qsys and programmed the full design to the FPGA (using the ARM);\r\n  * Wrote a C program that writes integers to a memory-mapped hps2fpga bridge;\r\n  * Successfully ran the C program on the ARM chip, getting tripled values back from the FPGA.\r\n\r\nFor the following week, we hope to:\r\n\r\n- Achieve communication FPGA -> ARM (hopefully directly accessing SDRAM, maybe peripherals?);\r\n- Obtain a second SoC board.\r\n- Decide on a project.\r\n\r\n---\r\nLawrence and Petar","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

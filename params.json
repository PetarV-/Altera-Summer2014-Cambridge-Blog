{"name":"Altera-Summer2014-Cambridge","tagline":"","body":"### Week 1\r\nDuring the first week of our internship, we have:\r\n\r\n- Attended Altera's training session in High Wycombe;\r\n- Learnt the basics of Bluespec SystemVerilog and used it to program several example modules;\r\n- Got all of Quartus' tools to work by locating missing libraries, fixing rules for USB device permissions, etc;\r\n- Booted the ARM processor on the SoCKit using an SD card containing Linux;\r\n- Interfaced to the ARM in two ways: initially using Minicom over a USB connection, now also via Ethernet+SSH to ease file transfer.\r\n- Successfully programmed the FPGA using the ARM (on-boot) as well as JTAG.\r\n- Established basic communication ARM -> FPGA, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n- Put linux on an SD card and used that to boot the on chip arm processor (which we can communicate with over minicom)\r\n- Wrote a simple bluespec program take creates an avalon slave that takes integers and returns them multiplied by 3\r\n- Connected the triple program to a HPC component in Qsys\r\n- Compiled the binary for the FPGA and transfered it to the SD card\r\n- Wrote a C program that takes numbers on on the command line and writes them to the memory mapped hpc2fpga bridge\r\n- Cross compiled the C program for arm, transfered it and the FPGA bitstream to the SD card\r\n- Programmed the FPGA from the arm chip.\r\n- Ran the C program on the arm, supplying numbers on the command line across minicom, successfully getting the trippled value back\r\n\r\nWe hope to...\r\n\r\n- Achieve communication on the fpga2hpc bridge (hopefully directly accessing SDRAM, maybe peripherals?)\r\n- Get ethernet connectivity.\r\n- Decide on a project\r\n\r\n---\r\nLawrence and Petar","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
